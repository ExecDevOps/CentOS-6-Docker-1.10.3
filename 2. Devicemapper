Docker stores all images and containers under /var/lib/docker. The storage space
for every container gets mounted by devicemapper via a loop-mount. This is 
totally wrong from a performace point of view and urgently needs to be replaced 
with an LVM based storage. The best is to store it on a separate (fast!) disk,
Docker will format it with CFS upon it's first start. Remove any existing data,
NOTE! any images / containers will be deleted:

	# rm -rf /var/lib/docker


Create a physical volume (PV) and a volumegroup (VG) and add the PV to the VG:

	# wipefs -a /dev/xvdb
	# pvcreate /dev/xvdb
	# vgcreate vg_docker /dev/xvdb


Create a logical volume (LV) where Docker will store it's data and metadata:

	# lvcreate --wipesignatures y -l 100%FREE -n lv_pool vg_docker


Sit back and enjoy the masterpiece:

	# lvs
	# lsblk
	# dmsetup table
