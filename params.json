  "tagline": "How to make CentOS 6.7 capable of running a more recent version of Docker",
  "body": "### Why bother running a more recent version of Docker on CentOS 6.7 than 1.7.1?\r\n\r\nWell, because I like CentOS 6.7. And dislike 7.x, or more precisely, I don't like to have to redo and re-learn everything. 6.7 runs fine for me, and what I have seen and read about systemd has so far not given me goose-bumps of anticipation. \r\n\r\n### Is it possible? Is it stable?\r\n\r\nPossible: definitely. Stable? good question! The kernel I used is the most recent from ElRepo so nothing strange there. Docker is 1.10.3 (the most recent one at the time I write this) and has so far worked well for me. As usual, YMMV and I do not take any responsability for nothing. \r\n\r\nThe only snag I have come across this far is that devicemapper does not work because of missing support for \"udev sync\" so no devicemapper here. This lead me to invastigate and try-out AUFS, which I abandoned because of the non-standard kernel that had to be Frankenstein-ed together with the rest of CentOS. Oh, and Docker by default uses devicemapper with loop mouts which seems to be a great way of scaring people away from RH/CentOS/OEL into the Debian/Ubuntu swamps so no loop-mounts either.\r\n\r\nOnly two storage methods remain: ZFS and BTRFS. ZFS, however great it may be, suffers from a Frankenstein-problem similar to AUFS which left me with BTRFS. People have been crying \"Wolf!\" over BTRFS for so long now that it has become a self-playing piano. It turned out that BTRFS is a nice companion to Docker, it works well and does not bother me so BTRFS it is then.\r\n\r\n### But then again, why?\r\n\r\nI run all my VMs on Xenserver (6.5 SP1) on an old (ancient?) HP ML150 G5 with 16 GB RAM / 2 x E5405 quad-core CPUs. Xenserver is free and has all major features one can expect from a hypervisor today. In contrast to the hefty pricetags of a full-blown VMware license or a SCOM--managed Hyper-V, Xenserver is lean, mean, feature-rich, comes with nice management-GUI and costs zero. Built on OpenSource it fits nicely into my ongoing struggle to throw off the MS-chains that has sneaked into our lives the last 20 or so years.\r\n\r\nAnyway, back to topic. I want to run a small, lean, fast VM with Docker on Xenserver. The VM needs to be fully integrated into Xenserver regarding i.e. performance monitoring, VM-motion, etc, etc. Xenserver has recently added support for managing Docker containers within VMs, CoreOS being the first supported Docker provider. Now I don't like CoreOS (there is no reasonable rationale behind it, it is just so) which created the need for an alternative. Since there is none (read about RancherOS below), I had to create one of my own, and I started out with my trusty beloved kickstart-based installation of CentOS 6.7 and jumped in. \r\n\r\nThe result of my hours googling for all kinds of answers is here, I can and do not want to take credit from whoever put up their bits and pieces on the Interwebs, I just summoned my findings here. Enjoy and remember to have fun!\r\n\r\n### P.S., RancherOS\r\n\r\nPromising, promising indeed! Although built upon Debian/Ubuntu (i think?) I kind of like the way they put it together. This could be the killer Docker-provider OS that I was searching for! Small, easy, secure and if they ever go past the little problem I (and others) stumbled upon with Docker not starting then I will give it a shot. That means that I will try to \"enhance\" it with the Xenserver Tools necessary for it to become a full-worthy member of Xenserver VMs with performance monitoring and VM motion, etc.",
